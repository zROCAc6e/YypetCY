# Architecture

**Snapdex** is a modern iOS app built with SwiftUI. It serves as a production-quality showcase of scalable architecture, modular design, and practical offline-first strategies. This guide outlines the technical decisions and structural patterns used in the app.

## Context

This guide was written to demonstrate how I approach building mobile apps as a senior engineer, with a focus on clean structure, real-world trade-offs, and long-term maintainability. While Snapdex is a solo project, Iâ€™ve structured it as if I were contributing to a production app in a team setting.

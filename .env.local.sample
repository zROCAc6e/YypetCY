# 📋 IMPORTANT SETUP NOTES
# ====================================================================
# 
# 1. 🔐 SECURITY: Never commit your actual .env.local file to version control
#    Copy this file to .env.local and replace all placeholder values
#
# 2. 🚀 GETTING STARTED: 
#    - You don't need ALL services to start development
#    - Begin with just Supabase for basic functionality
#    - Add other OAuth providers as needed for authentication features
#
# 3. 📚 LEARNING PATH:
#    If you're new to these services, we recommend learning in this order:
#    a) Supabase (Database & Auth) - Essential for core functionality
#    b) NextAuth.js setup - For authentication system
#    c) Google Gemini API - For AI features
#    d) OAuth providers (GitHub, Google, etc.) - For social login
#    e) Cloudinary - For image uploads and management
#
# 4. 💡 TROUBLESHOOTING:
#    - Make sure to enable the correct APIs in respective consoles
#    - Set proper redirect URIs in OAuth app settings
#    - Check that your domain is authorized for production deployments

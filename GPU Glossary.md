A

  [Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit) is an integrated circuit (IC) chip customized for a particular use in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, professional workstations, rather than intended for general use.
  
  [Apple Hypervisor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/hypervisor) is a frameowrk that builds virtualization solutions on top of a lightweight hypervisor, without third-party kernel extensions. Hypervisor provides C APIs so you can interact with virtualization technologies in user space, without writing kernel extensions (KEXTs). As a result, the apps you create using this framework are suitable for distribution on the [Mac App Store](https://www.appstore.com/).

   [Apple Virtualization Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization) is a framework that provides high-level APIs for creating and managing virtual machines on Apple silicon and Intel-based Mac computers. This framework is used to boot and run a Linux-based operating system in a custom environment that you define. It also supports the [Virtio specification](https://www.redhat.com/en/virtio-networking-series), which defines standard interfaces for many device types, including network, socket, serial port, storage, entropy, and memory-balloon devices.

   [Apple Paravirtualized Graphics Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/paravirtualizedgraphics) is a framework that implements hardware-accelerated graphics for macOS running in a virtual machine, hereafter known as the guest. The operating system provides a graphics driver that runs inside the guest, communicating with the framework in the host operating system to take advantage of Metal-accelerated graphics.

E

 [Error Correction Code (ECC) memory](https://www.crucial.com/products/memory/server/ecc) is a method of detecting and then correcting single-bit memory errors. A single-bit memory error is a data error in server output or production, and the presence of errors can have a big impact on server performance. The two types of single-bit memory errors: **hard errors and soft errors**. **Hard errors** are caused by physical factors, such as excessive temperature variation, voltage stress, or physical stress brought upon the memory bits. **Soft errors** occur when data is written or read differently than originally intended, such as variations in voltage on the motherboard, to cosmic rays or radioactive decay that can cause bits in the memory to flip.

  [EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory)](https://www.futureelectronics.com/c/semiconductors/memory--RAM--eeprom) is a type of non-volatile memory used in integrated in microcontrollers for smart cards/remote keyless systems, and other electronic devices to store relatively small amounts of data by allowing individual bytes to be erased and reprogrammed as needed in an application.

  [EPROM](https://www.minitool.com/lib/eprom.html) is a memory chip that does not lose data even when the power is switched off. This is a non-volatile memory type so it retains data even when the power is switched off. Each EPROM is individually programmed by an electronic device.

N

  [Network interface cards (NICs)](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/documentation/supplemental/11/best-practices-for-using-multiple-network-interfaces--nics--with.html) is a network interface controller, network adapter, or Local Area Network ( LAN) adapter. It provides network connections for devices like computers and servers.
  
  [Non-Transparent Bridging (NTB)](https://docs.nvidia.com/drive/drive_os_5.1.6.1L/nvvib_docs/index.html#page/DRIVE_OS_Linux_SDK_Development_Guide/System%20Programming/sys_components_non_transparent_bridging.html#) is a process that enables a inter-domain communication, facilitating communication between devices in different switch partitions. This ability enables both hosts and EPs to initiate transactions to hosts and/or EPs in another switch partition. An NTB or NT Interconnection consists of two or more PCI functions each defined by a Type 0 PCI header that are interconnected by a bridging function. The Type 0 PCI functions are referred to as Non-Transparent EPs (NT EP). Each partition can have at most one NT EP.

O 


   [oVirt](https://www.ovirt.org) is an open-source distributed virtualization solution, designed to manage your entire enterprise infrastructure. oVirt uses the trusted KVM hypervisor and is built upon several other community projects, including libvirt, Gluster, PatternFly, and Ansible.Founded by Red Hat as a community project on which Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization is based allowing for centralized management of virtual machines, compute, storage and networking resources, from an easy-to-use web-based front-end with platform independent access.

  [Open vSwitch(OVS)](https://www.openvswitch.org/)is an open source production quality, multilayer virtual switch licensed under the open source Apache 2.0 license. It is designed to enable massive network automation through programmatic extension, while still supporting standard management interfaces and protocols (NetFlow, sFlow, IPFIX, RSPAN, CLI, LACP, 802.1ag).

P 

  [PV(ParaVirtualization)](https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Paravirtualization_(PV)) is an efficient and lightweight virtualization technique introduced by the Xen Project team, later adopted by other virtualization solutions. PV does not require virtualization extensions from the host CPU and thus enables virtualization on hardware architectures that do not support Hardware-assisted virtualization.

Q 

  [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org) is a fast processor emulator using a portable dynamic translator. QEMU emulates a full system, including a processor and various peripherals. It can be used to launch a different Operating System without rebooting the PC or to debug system code.

R

  [Random Access Memory (RAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory) is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code. A random access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory, in contrast with other direct-access data storage media. 
  
  [Remote Direct Memory Access(RDMA)fabrics](https://core.vmware.com/resource/basics-remote-direct-memory-access-rdma-vsphere) is an extenion of the Direct Memory Acces (DMA) technology, which is the ability to access host memory directly without CPU intervention. RDMA allows for accessing memory data from one host to another. A key charateric for RDMA is that it greatly improves throughput and performance because less CPU cycles are needed to process the network packets.
  
  [RT (Real-time ray tracing) Cores](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-turing-architecture-in-depth/) is a hardware-based ray tracing acceleration accelerate Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) traversal and ray/triangle intersection testing (ray casting) functions. RT Cores perform visibility testing on behalf of threads running in the SM, allowing it to handle another vertex, pixel, and compute shading work.

Its high-speed serial interface and optimized protocol enable significant improvements in throughput and system performance.

V

  [Video Random Access Memory (VRAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRAM) is the RAM allocated to store image or graphics related data. It functions in the same way as RAM, storing specific data for easier access and performance. Image data is first read by the processor and written on the VRAM. It is then converted by a [RAMDAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAMDAC) or a RAM digital-to-analog converter and display as graphics output.
  
  [Vector Processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_processor) is a central processing unit (CPU) that implements an instruction set where its instructions are designed to operate efficiently and effectively on large one-dimensional arrays of data called vectors.
  
  [Virtual memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory) is a memory management technique that is implemented by using both hardware (central processing unit (CPU)) and software. It makes a program think it has available storage space or address space. When actually virtual memory usually is divided into several physical memory fragments, and stored on the disk storage(SSD or HDD) which can be used to exchange data when needed. On Windows this is called a [Pagefile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/introduction-page-file) or on Linux a [Swap space](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/storage_administration_guide/ch-swapspace).

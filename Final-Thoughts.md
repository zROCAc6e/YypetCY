### Final Thoughts

Thank you so much for following along and finishing my course. As you can see, this is one of the topics that I literally love and feel very passionate about. This is why I've spent a lot of time doing research and trying to learn new things, about new tools and most of all new vulnerabilities.

I really hope you enjoyed and learned even just a little about reversing iOS applications. Even if all you learned was how to properly pronounce `Cycript`, I'd still be very happy.

On a more serious note, I honestly hope this course inspired you to start your own research, to get involved with the community and teach us something new and exciting that we don't know about! And if you find vulnerabilities, please do the responsible thing and report them to the author(s). Remember there are companies with public bug bounty programs on [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/), [Bugcrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/) and [Synack](https://www.synack.com/) if you're doing a good job and show potential they add you to private programs. 😉

Please, please let me know if there are mistakes, typos or if any of the information throughout the course is inaccurate 🙏🏼 remember that English is my second language, if there are sentences that can be improved also let me know.

Since this is an open source course, there might be people that use it to provide a course on their own or take ideas from here to their own courses. That is **exactly** the idea behind me open sourcing it, just please mention me if you do use the material. 😬

And lastly, pay it forward. If you can share your research, your knowledge or your time please do it!
